It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\"\n      },\n      {\n        id: 2,\n        title: \"Cloud Computing\",\n        content:\n          \"As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[2] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.[3] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.[4] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[5] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[6] autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    searchString: \"\"\n  };\n\n  handleChange = e => {\n    this.setState({\n      searchString: e.target.value\n    });\n  };\n  render() {\n    const { listdata, searchString } = this.state;\n    const filteredData = listdata.filter(data =>\n      data.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchString.toLowerCase())\n    );\n\n    const details = props => {\n      console.log(props);\n      let name = props.match.params.topic;\n      console.log(name);\n      let current = this.state.listdata.find(\n        ind => ind.title.toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase()\n      );\n\n      return <Single {...props} name={current} />;\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route\n            exact\n            path=\"/\"\n            render={() => (\n              <div>\n                <Search\n                  handleChange={this.handleChange}\n                  val={this.state.searchString}\n                />\n                <List data={filteredData} />\n              </div>\n            )}\n          />\n          <Route exact path=\"/topics/:topic\" render={details} />\n        </Switch>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
